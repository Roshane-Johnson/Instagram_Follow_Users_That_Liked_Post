## Getting Started
This script clicks the follow button on the carousel/popup for user's that liked a specific post.

## Usage
* Open likes on a selected post.
	* It should look like this:
	![Instagram Likes Carousel Image 1](https://i.ibb.co/bWVHNxW/ig1.jpg)
	![Instagram Likes Carousel Image 2](https://i.ibb.co/p3Bv2PS/ig22.jpg)
	
* Paste the code from the .js file to the console tab.
	* To get there you can use the shortcut on most browsers which is `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I`.
	* If the shortcut doesn't work just google "developer options for [your browser name]".
	* Navigate to the console tab and paste the code there.

* Hit `Enter` on your keyboard and let the magic happen.
## Developer Note
In my experience it only clicks 17 buttons at a time. I  don't know if that's a render limitation so I added a line of code
which only allows you to do 45 on each run if it renders that much.
You should research Instagram's limitations before using this script. So that you don't get action blocked by Instagram.
